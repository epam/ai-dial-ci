## Overview

Continuous Integration instrumentation for [AI DIAL](https://epam-rail.com) components.

Contains reusable workflows for AI-DIAL group of repositories under EPAM GitHub organization.

    steps:
      - name: Slash Command Dispatch
        id: scd
        uses: peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch@13bc09769d122a64f75aa5037256f6f2d78be8c4 # v4.0.0

          config: >
            [
              {
                "command": "deploy-review",
                "issue_type": "pull-request",
                "repository": "epam/ai-dial-ci",
                "static_args": [
                  "application=${{ github.event.repository.name }}"
                ]
              }
            ]
```

### Cleanup for untagged images in GHCR

```yml
name: Cleanup untagged images

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"

jobs:
  clean:
    name: Delete untagged images
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      packages: write
    steps:
      - uses: snok/container-retention-policy@4f22ef80902ad409ed55a99dc5133cc1250a0d03 # v3.0.0
        with:
          account: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          image-names: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
          tag-selection: "untagged"
          cut-off: "1d"
```

### Dependency Review (Java (gradle))

To support Dependabot security updates, GitHub requires uploading dependency graph data to GitHub's Dependency Graph API. To enable this feature, add the workflow from example below to your repository. You'll start getting review comments on PRs.

```yml
name: Dependency Review

on:
  pull_request_target:
    types:
      - opened
      - synchronize

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  dependency-review:
    uses: epam/ai-dial-ci/.github/workflows/java_dependency_review.yml@main
    secrets:
      ACTIONS_BOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_BOT_TOKEN }}
```

### Trivy additional configuration

To change predefined Trivy parameters or set up additional configuration options, create `trivy.yaml` file in root of your repository. Use example below to add fallback repositories for vulnerabilities and checks DB and thus mitigate rate limit issues.

```yaml
# Trivy configuration file
# https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/docs/references/configuration/config-file/
db:
  no-progress: true
  repository:
    - mirror.gcr.io/aquasec/trivy-db:2
    - public.ecr.aws/aquasecurity/trivy-db:2
    - ghcr.io/aquasecurity/trivy-db:2
  java-repository:
    - mirror.gcr.io/aquasec/trivy-java-db:1
    - public.ecr.aws/aquasecurity/trivy-java-db:1
    - ghcr.io/aquasecurity/trivy-java-db:1
misconfiguration:
  checks-bundle-repository: mirror.gcr.io/aquasec/trivy-checks:1
```
