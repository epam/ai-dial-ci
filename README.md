## Overview

Continuous Integration instrumentation for [AI DIAL](https://epam-rail.com) components.

Contains reusable workflows for AI-DIAL group of repositories under EPAM GitHub organization.

## Usage

These workflows could be imported to any repository under EPAM GitHub organization as standard `.github/workflows` files. See examples below (replace `@main` with specific version tag).
